# Single Click Action

Tiny Fantasy Grounds extension that prevents players from accidentally
double-clicking on power action buttons and in doing so, casting a spell twice
or doing damage or healing twice.

### Why

Having to double-click on weapon attacks but single-click on spell attacks
regularly causes mistakes and head-scratches from newer or infrequent players.
Having to fix spell attack rolls and damage live also causes delays on my end
during combat.
